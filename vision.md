## Distill

- The DAOs who need access to credit will use Porter to achieve financing because Porter offers under-collateralized financing without the threat of liquidation which allows DAOs to focus on building and makes them feel safe.
- The investors who need to find yield bearing assets will use Porter to achieve a competitive return because Porter offers liquid, high yield bonds that offer downside protection in a bear market which makes investors feel safe.
