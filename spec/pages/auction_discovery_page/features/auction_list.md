# Auction list

## Purpose

The purpose of the auction list is to allow a user to discover and distinguish between vetted and unvetted auctions.

## Implementation

Lists will be implemented as a table with an explanation of what curated auctions are at the top for vetted and a warning for unvetted. There will also be a link to learn more about the curators and apply to be added to their list. The information and application can be handled off our platform.
